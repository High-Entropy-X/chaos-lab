## 🎨 About Chaos Lab

**Chaos Lab** is an ever-evolving playground of randomness, creativity, and experimentation. This is my digital sandbox where I build and break things, try out new ideas, and explore whatever catches my curiosity. There's no specific theme or purpose—just pure entropic fun!

Whether it's mini-games, time-killing tools, quirky experiments, or random pages that make no sense, you'll find it all here. Dive in, click around, and see where the chaos takes you!
